Fixes
- None?

Gameplay
- See food inside house / animation for births
- Animations for priests/sacrifice etc
- Balance stuff
- Polish camera (zoom, etc)
- Do something with trees
- God gameplay: faith, cataclysm
- Detect game over, display score and stuff

Could be good
- Optimize A* with roads heuristic
- Minimap

Won't do
- Prevent workers from running into each other
- Place roads by dragging
- Put a beard and maybe a cap to the loggers
- Music/sound
- Meteorite water

To balance:
- speed of every class
- night/day time
- road Factor
- animation times of every class
- wood per tree
- wood per building
- faith constants
- food constants
- apparition probz of classes
- debut town

Destroy temple = big malus in faith
Escape from meteorite: increase in faith?
Skip night
What is the point of roads? They have no cost
Priests could be beneficial?
GUI for houses?
